Lending to 'Risky' applicants is the primary source of financial loss, known as credit loss. This occurs when the borrower fails to repay or absconds with the borrowed amount.

The main goal is to identify these risky loan applicants, thereby reducing the issuance of such loans and cutting down on credit loss. The aim of this case study is to identify these applicants using exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Conduct an analysis to understand the driving factors, or key variables, behind loan default. Identifying these strong indicators of default will help the company in portfolio and risk assessment.
